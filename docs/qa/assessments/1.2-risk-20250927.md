### 6. PERF-002: Memory Leaks from Log Buffer Management

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Improper buffer management could lead to memory accumulation
**Impact**: Medium - Long-running applications may experience gradual memory degradation
**Mitigation**:

- Implement proper buffer size limits and cleanup

- Use memory-efficient data structures

**Testing Focus**: Long-running stress tests, memory profiling, leak detection analysis

## Low Risks

### 7. BUS-001: Developer Adoption Resistance

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Team is generally receptive to quality improvements, but change management needed
**Impact**: Low - May slow initial adoption but won't block implementation
**Mitigation**:

- Provide comprehensive training and documentation
- Create migration guides with before/after examples
- Implement gradual rollout with early adopters
- Gather feedback and iterate on implementation
- Show performance benefits through metrics

### 8. TECH-002: Cross-Platform Compatibility Issues

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Flutter's cross-platform nature reduces compatibility risks
**Impact**: Low - Minor platform-specific adjustments may be needed
**Mitigation**:

- Test on all target platforms (iOS, Android, Web)
