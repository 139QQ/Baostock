# Quality Assessment Summary:
# - Architecture: Strong (PASS) - Clean BLoC pattern, proper dependency injection
# - Reliability: Strong (PASS) - Comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
# - Test Coverage: Concerns (50% full, 25% partial, 25% none)
# - Security: Concerns - Missing rate limiting and input validation
# - Performance: Concerns - SLA not validated, no monitoring
# - Overall Quality Score: 80/100

# Recommendation: Address high-severity issues before production deployment
# Blockers: Performance SLA validation, API security hardening
# Can Proceed With: Awareness and tracking of medium-severity issues
