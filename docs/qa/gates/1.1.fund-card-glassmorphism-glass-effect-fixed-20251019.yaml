notes: |
  Story 1.1 has been successfully enhanced to address all reliability concerns identified in the initial review.
  The implementation now includes enterprise-grade error handling, retry mechanisms, circuit breaker patterns,
  and comprehensive logging. All acceptance criteria are met and the implementation is ready for
  production deployment. The glassmorphism effect implementation follows best practices and integrates
  well with existing architecture patterns while providing robust reliability features.
