  notes: |
    Trace matrix: docs/qa/assessments/1.1.fund-card-glassmorphism-glass-effect-trace-20251019.md

    ✅ All critical acceptance criteria have full test coverage
    ✅ Performance requirements (AC3) comprehensively tested
    ✅ API compatibility (AC5) thoroughly validated
    ✅ Theme integration (AC4, AC8) well covered
    ⚠️  Minor gap in AC2 for multi-element transparency (low severity)

    Overall test coverage is excellent at 87.5% with only one partial coverage gap
    in a non-critical area. The implementation demonstrates strong quality practices
    with comprehensive test coverage across all functional requirements.
