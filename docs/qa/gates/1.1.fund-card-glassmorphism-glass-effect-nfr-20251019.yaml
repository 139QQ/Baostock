recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Implement retry logic for performance monitoring failures"
    - "Add comprehensive error logging"
    - "Document error recovery procedures"

  short_term:
    - "Implement circuit breaker pattern"
    - "Add health check mechanisms"
    - "Create performance monitoring dashboard"

conditions_for_pass:
  - "Implement retry logic for performance monitoring failures"
  - "Add comprehensive error logging"
  - "Document error recovery procedures"

notes: |
  Overall implementation quality is high with excellent security, performance, and maintainability.
  Main concern is limited reliability features which are addressable with minimal effort.
  The glassmorphism effect implementation follows best practices and integrates well
  with existing architecture patterns.
