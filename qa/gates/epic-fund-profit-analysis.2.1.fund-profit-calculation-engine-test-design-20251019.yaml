**Gate Decision**: PASS

**Rationale**: Comprehensive test design covering all 12 acceptance criteria with appropriate test levels. Critical risks (PERF-001, PERF-002, DATA-001, SEC-001) are fully covered with 42 test scenarios. Test distribution follows best practices with 57% unit tests for fast feedback and adequate integration/E2E coverage for critical paths.

**Key Strengths**:
1. Complete acceptance criteria coverage (100%)
2. Critical risk comprehensive mitigation
3. Appropriate test level distribution
4. Clear execution strategy and phases
5. Detailed test data and environment requirements

**Readiness for Implementation**: Test design is production-ready and provides a solid foundation for quality assurance of the fund profit calculation engine.

**Estimated Implementation Timeline**: 3 weeks for complete test suite development and execution
